# Going Beyond: Advanced Techniques for Your Kryll.io Bots

## Overview

After mastering the basics and exploring some of the possibilities offered by Kryll's variable blocks, it's time to go one step further and explore more advanced concepts that can be implemented within your trading bots. This section introduces two significant concepts, managing function returns and implementing state machines. These concepts take your bot-building skills to new heights and provide you with the tools to create more efficient, flexible, and robust bots.

## What will you learn?

In this section, you will delve deeper into the following topics:

1. **Managing Function Returns**: You will learn how to emulate behavior similar to the CALL and RET instructions in assembly language. This advanced technique can be achieved in Kryll by using a variable to record the place from where a "function" is called. After the function's task is completed, the bot can be guided to the location previously recorded.

2. **State Machines in Your Bots**: Learn how to implement a state machine in your bot, a design pattern that allows your bot to change its behavior based on its internal state. You can use a variable to represent the current state of your bot and control the execution flow of your bot based on this state variable.
